Welcome to my personal website project! This project is a platform that I have developed to share my thoughts, ideas,
and experiences as a software engineer.

On this website, you will find a range of content, including blog posts, technical articles, and resources for software
developers. I cover a wide range of topics, including software development best practices, new technologies, and my
experiences working in the tech industry.

## PatternFly

I would like to give a special shoutout to the team at PatternFly for their awesome project,
patternfly-react-seed (https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react-seed). This project provided a great starting
point for my personal website, and it has made it much easier for me to get up and run the new website.
